# sentiment-analysis-twitter-textblob
A simple code to test out the sentiment analysis using tweepy and textblob

To use the code, we need at first to get the API configuration strings (Consumer Key (API Key), Consumer Secret (API Secret), Access Token, Access Token Secret). We can get it after creating a twitter app using [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/).

This project is part of the <b>#100DaysOfMLCode</b> challenge proposed By [Siraj Raval](https://twitter.com/sirajraval).
